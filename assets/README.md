The assets/ directory is used to add all the website's assets that the build tool will process.
The directory usually contains the following types of files:
- Stylesheets (CSS, SASS, etc.)
- Fonts
- Images that won't be served from the public/ directory.
If you want to serve assets from the server, we recommend taking a look at the public/ directory.
